>Well, the story we are telling you is that God told us "Here's a logic gate, NAND, now go and build a computer".

This repository contains the completed project files of the excellent Coursera course **Build a Modern Computer from First Principles: From Nand to Tetris** by [Noam Nisan](http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~noam/) and [Shimon Schocken](http://www.shimonschocken.com/).  
  
  
The course is currently offered in two parts on Coursera:
 1. [Build a Modern Computer from First Principles: From Nand to Tetris (Project-Centered Course)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer) (Completed on 17/05/2020)
 2. [Build a Modern Computer from First Principles: Nand to Tetris Part II (Project-Centered Course)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/nand2tetris2)
   
   
The intent of the course is to build a fully functional computer, beginning from a NAND gate all the way up to an Operating System within **12 weeks**. There are no prerequisites for the course, apart from a general understanding of Computers and an eagerness to learn. The lectures cover all important technical aspects in an enjoyable manner. The course is based on the book [**The Elements of Computing Systems**](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Computing-Systems-Building-Principles/dp/0262640686/ref=ed_oe_p) written by Noam and Shimon.  
   
   
Project files are provided not for cheating, but to encourage a discussion on how solutions could be further developed and optimized. I will go about updating the files as I complete the courses/develop additional functions. If you have any suggestions/improvements on the project code, you are more than welcome to make a pull request or [email me](mailto:fabian.alwis@gmail.com) your suggestion.
